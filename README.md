# Midterm Project for [Boolean](https://boolean.careers/)

Project: Bakery Website
Languages uses:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Framework: **Vue**

## Project Directions

For this project our restriction is the framework to use: [VueJS v2](https://v2.vuejs.org/) using [VueCli](https://cli.vuejs.org/) for scaffolding.
We have been provided with the design of the layout as if we were working for a client. We need to implement the design layout as close as possible to the request of our hypothetic designer.

All of the images and the colour schemes have also been provided.

From here, we are left to do the work in **4 days** roughly with a presentation at the end.

## Step 1: Analysis

Instead of jumping in blind, I decided to sit down and create the **abstract structure** of the application first by splitting it into various subcomponents that can then be implemented in an efficient and scalable way. Having a conceptualized view of the entire app can help avoiding hours of refactoring and bugs at the end.

The abstract structure of my project can be found here: [Bakery Project](https://www.figma.com/file/8rrldVduPNee50hDXEfqFx/Boolean-Project-%2F-Case-Study%3A-Bakery?node-id=0%3A1).
